DSA Concepts Used
1. Linked Lists
Utilized in managing player data, where a linked list structure facilitates dynamic memory allocation and efficient traversal, insertion, and deletion of player nodes.

2. Trees
Could potentially be employed in other parts of the project, such as representing hierarchical data structures like tournament brackets or organizational charts.

3. Vectors
Used for storing dynamic arrays of player and sponsor data, offering flexibility in size and efficient random access to elements.

4. Sorting Algorithms
Likely implemented in functionalities such as sorting players based on statistics or arranging sponsors alphabetically, ensuring data is presented in a meaningful and organized manner.

Code Structure
The code follows a modular structure with separate sections for function declarations, including authentication-related functions, menu-related functions, team management functions, player management functions, sponsor management functions, and match management functions. It starts with necessary header file inclusions, followed by function declarations and implementations, organized logically to handle different aspects of the cricket management system.

Conclusion
The Cricket Management System is a well-structured console-based application designed to manage various aspects of cricket team operations efficiently. Through a combination of header files, global variables, and modular functions, the project achieves a high level of organization and readability. Overall, this system demonstrates effective implementation of concepts such as modular programming, file handling, and user interaction, making it a valuable tool for managing cricket teams efficiently. Further enhancements could include additional features and refinements.
